# Metabolic Network
**The metabolism-related subnetwork analysis is executed through an analyzer specifically designed to identify subnetwork based on input gene- and metabolite-level summary data.**  

## Meta-Gene Network

**Procedure**

<ul>  

<li>Step 1: Enter **Metabolite Data**, **GeneExp Data** and **Group Data**,  respectively.  

<li>Step 2: Select **Nodes Number**.  

In R network analysis, nodes number refers to the total count of nodes, representing individual elements or entities within the network.

<li>Step 3: Select **Figure Format** and adjust **figure width, height and DPI**.  

<li>Step 4: click **Figure Download** to export analysis result.  

</ul>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Results**

By utilising the dbNet knowledgebase and employing the dnet algorithm, MNet analyses a list of genes and metabolites along with their significance information, allowing a graphical display of the metabolism-related subnetwork that contains both genes and metabolites
