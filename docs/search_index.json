[["index.html", "MNet Manual 1 OVERVIEW", " MNet Manual 2024-10-31 1 OVERVIEW Motivation Advance since any previous publication (if relevant): Integration of metabolomic and transcriptomic data is vital for pathway-centric, systems-biology understandings of disease (Nucleic Acids Research 2022 and Communications Biology 2023). Existing pathway knowledgebases, including but not limited to BiGG (Nucleic Acids Research 2020), KEGG (Nucleic Acids Research 2023), Reactome (Nucleic Acids Research 2024), SMPDB (Nucleic Acids Research 2014), and WikiPathways (Nucleic Acids Research 2024), provide metabolic pathway information on genes and metabolites. However, these databases lack the comprehensive integration of both metabolites and genes necessary for downstream pathway and subnetwork analyses, thereby limiting the exploration of potential therapeutic targets from a metabolomic perspective. Our well-established algorithm/tool called ‘dnet’ and its related software(Genome Medicine 2014, Genome Medicine 2016 and Nature Genetics 2019) have received nearly 400 citations over time (AS OF October 2024 according to Google Scholar). They excel at identifying core subnetwork using prior knowledge but has been limited to genomic or transcriptomic challenges, without extending its application to metabolomics. In this aspect, MNet supports pathway-centric, network-driven analyses, enabling by the compilation of the dbMNet knowledgebase, which includes dbKEGG and dbNet. The dbKEGG facilitates KEGG metabolic pathway-based extended pathway analysis to identify dysregulated metabolic pathways involving both metabolites and genes. The dbNet enhances metabolism-related subnetwork analysis by leveraging gene-metabolite and metabolite-metabolite information to identify subnetwork that best explain the input data.

Step 2: Select Nodes Number. In R network analysis, nodes number refers to the total count of nodes, representing individual elements or entities within the network. Step 3: Select Figure Format and adjust figure width, height and DPI. Step 4: Click the User panel to view the input and output, and finally click Figure Download and export the analysis results. Demo data Expand the Demo Panel and click Metabolic Data to download demo data, which comprises an integrated analysis of metabolomic and transcriptomic profiles in triple-negative breast cancer. Metabolite Data: an interactive table for user-input metabolic data with rows corresponding to metabolites and columns corresponding to samples. GeneExp Data: an interactive table for user-input metabolic data with rows corresponding to genes and columns correspond to the samples. Group Data: Group information. 2.1.2 Results By utilising the dbNet knowledgebase and employing the dnet algorithm, MNet analyses a list of genes and metabolites along with their significance information, allowing a graphical display of the metabolism-related subnetwork that contains both genes and metabolites. Figure 1. Visualization of the identified optimal subnetwork that best explains the biological processes comparing two groups. The colors represent the logFC (logarithm of fold change) of genes, with red and green indicating different expression levels, while yellow and blue represent the logFC of metabolites, indicating varying levels.
